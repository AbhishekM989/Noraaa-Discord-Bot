## Can I self-host Noraaa?
I wouldn't recommend it. Self-hosting this bot (running a copy yourself) is not supported, and no help will be provided for editing nor compiling the code in this repository. The source code is provided here for transparency about how the bot's primary features work. If you decide to edit, compile, or use this code in any way, please respect the [**license**](https://github.com/AbhishekM989/Kurama-Discord-Bot/blob/main/LICENSE)
